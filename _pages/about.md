Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Political Science department at UCLA. My research interests are in Political Economy. Specifically, I study economic reform, sovereign debt politics, and distributive politics. I am primarily interested in developing countries, but my regional focus is the Middle East. My methodological interests include the application and development of Causal Inference, Machine Learning, Bayesian techniques, and Time Series. You may contact me at mwidmann@ucla.edu.
