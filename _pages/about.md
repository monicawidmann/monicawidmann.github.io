Welcome! For the 2023-2024 academic year, I will be a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Princeton University's Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance. I am scheduled to complete my PhD in the Political Science department at UCLA in the summer of 2023. My research interests are in Political Economy. Specifically, I study economic reform, sovereign debt politics, and distributive politics. I am broadly interested in developing countries, but my regional focus is the Middle East. My methodological interests include the application and development of Causal Inference, Machine Learning, Bayesian techniques, and Time Series. You may contact me at mwidmann@ucla.edu.
